# EECS-281-Cheating-Paper
> ### It seems that certain Latex codes can't be rendered properly. So, download the Markdown files and view them in Typora (```With Math Mode Enabled```).
> ### Under that case, the format should be good to go.
> ### Since I have only uploaded these 2 files after the final, I have not considered that issue when I wrote the notes. Moveover, I don't want to modify them anymore since it will be meaningless work as I have already finished the final.
> ### Besides, solution to this issue found online seems clumsy to me, so I giveup that thought.
> ### However, to get a general idea of what the notes would look like, Jupyter Notebook is sufficient. So, I also included 2 Jupyter files though I personally perfer the Typora version.
